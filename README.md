Envelope Budgeting API project

This is a backend API project that demonstrates simple CRUD functionality. The concept of envelope budgeting is by putting a budget amount to an envelope, the enveloped money is used for personal expenditures.

    E.g. each envelope represent the budget set for things like utilities, car maintenance, or entertainment. 

Basic API features:

    GET: all envelopes, one envelope by ID
    
    PUT: modify envelope by ID
    
    POST: subtract budget, transfer budget
    
    DELETE: delete envelope by ID

There are several backend components that I want to showcase here:

    Basic CRUD function

    Usage of Middleware

    Error Handling
